[2025-08-30] Status and Plan

Completed (current repo state)
- printf integrated in backend: single consolidated call arm; auto-declares `declare i32 @printf(ptr, ...)`; passes format and pointer args as `ptr`, integers as `i32`.
- Ternary (?:) lowered via branches with join block (alloca/store/br/load) to satisfy cond tests.
- Cleanup: removed duplicated fragments in emit_expr; fixed casts and brace mismatches.
- Test suites green:
  - Backend IR tests all pass, including new printf vararg-typing test.
  - Driver runtime tests added for printf: basic, multiple args, hex (%x/%X), unsigned (%u), pointer (%p), and mixed formats — all pass via wyrmcc run pipeline.

Next Work
1) Expand printf coverage (tests only; functionality relies on system libc):
   - Add driver tests covering common flags/width/precision:
     - Zero pad width: printf("%05d\n", 7) -> 00007
     - Left-justify: printf("%-6dX\n", 7) -> "7     X"
     - Plus sign for positives: printf("%+d\n", 7) -> +7
     - Space flag: printf(" %d\n", 7) ->  7
     - Alternate form for hex: printf("%#x %#X\n", 255, 255) -> 0xff 0XFF
     - Precision on strings: printf("%.3s\n", "hello") -> hel
     - Literal percent: printf("%%\n") -> %
   - Keep tests in crates/driver/tests using the existing harness (assert_cmd, predicates). No backend changes expected.

2) Next feature (compiler/backend): pointer subtraction (ptr - ptr)
   - Semantics (C89 subset): When both operands are pointers to the same element type (initially support int), result is (difference in elements) in i32 (ptrdiff_t surrogate). For now, limit to pointers to int; future work can generalize via sizeof(element).
   - Backend lowering sketch:
     - Compute ptrtoint for both pointers to i64, subtract, divide by element size (4 for int) to produce i32.
     - Ensure unsigned/overflow behavior is not UB for well-formed inputs (same array/object).
   - Tests to add:
     - Backend IR test: confirm `ptrtoint`, `sub`, `sdiv 4` (or arithmetic sequence producing i32 result) are present.
     - Driver runtime test: create two pointers into the same int array and return (p2 - p1); expect correct element count.

Execution Checklist
- [ ] Add driver tests for printf flags/width/precision listed above; run `cargo test -p wyrmcc`.
- [ ] Add backend IR + driver runtime tests for pointer subtraction; run `cargo test -p backend` and `cargo test -p wyrmcc`.
- [ ] Implement ptr - ptr lowering in backend if tests require it; re-run suites until green.

Notes
- printf coverage expansion leverages libc; no compiler changes unless arg typing issues surface (current scheme: ints=i32, pointers=ptr).
- Pointer subtraction: start with pointers to int only; extend later as type system matures.

[2025-08-30] Progress Update

Summary (since last update):
- Backend
  - Cleaned and consolidated Expr::Call with puts/printf/generic handling.
  - Integrated printf: declare i32 @printf(ptr, ...); typed args (ptr for format/pointers, i32 for ints).
  - Implemented ternary (?:) via branch-and-join (alloca result, br i1 then/else, join load).
  - Implemented pointer subtraction (ptr - ptr) -> element difference using ptrtoint and divide by element size.
  - Function-scope static locals implemented (internal globals @__static_<fn>_<name>), including pointer initializers from string/null.
  - Global emission/linkage: deduplication and priority (definition > tentative > extern).
  - All backend tests green (printf IR, cond lowering, ptr-sub, arrays, structs/unions, loops, switch, variadics, etc.).
- Sema
  - TU-level linkage checks in place: extern decl-only allowed; extern with initializer errors; multiple tentatives allowed; duplicate definitions are errors. Tests pass.
- Driver
  - Added and validated runtime tests for printf (wyrmcc): mixed ints/pointers/hex/unsigned/pointers. All pass end-to-end with system toolchain.

Next Focus (toward full C89): Phase 2.1 – Function Prototypes and Call Checking
- Goal: Enforce prototype signatures, arity/type checks (including variadics), and apply usual arithmetic conversions at call sites.
- Plan:
  1) Extend sema function symbol table: parameter types, variadic flag, and prototype vs definition tracking.
  2) At call sites, check:
     - Too few/many args -> diagnostic.
     - Type mismatch in fixed params -> diagnostic.
     - Variadic calls: fixed param checks; allow extra args with default argument promotions.
  3) Apply integer promotions/usual arithmetic conversions for arguments as needed (staged coverage).
- Tests to add now (sema):
  - Too few args, too many args.
  - Type mismatch (e.g., int expected, ptr given).
  - Variadic: fixed part checked; extras permitted; mismatch in fixed part rejected.
  - Smoke compile remains unchanged in backend.

Notes toward full C89 roadmap
- Upcoming: 2.2 Typedef resolution across scopes; 1.x integer model + promotions breadth; 3.x aggregate initializers; 4.x function pointers/indirect calls; 6.x minimal CPP integration via driver.

[2025-08-30] Sema Prototype/Call Checking
- Implemented function signatures (incl. built-ins puts, printf); enforced arity and fixed-arg type checks with array-to-pointer decay; variadics accepted after fixed part.
- Added sema tests (too few/many args, fixed-arg type mismatch, variadic behavior, built-ins); all passing.
- Backend remains green (printf integrated, ternary via branches, ptr - ptr subtraction).
Next: Phase 2.2 – Typedef resolution across scopes (tests first, then implementation).

[2025-08-30] Sync And Tests Status
- Workspace fully green after fixing Sema::from_tu call.
- Parser: added support for typedef array declarators (e.g., `typedef int A[10];`) and for parsing declarations that use unknown typedef-names (e.g., `T x;`) so sema can emit proper diagnostics.
- Sema: prototypes/call checking (arity, type checks, variadics), typedef resolution across scopes, and labels/goto checks are implemented; tests pass.
- Driver printf coverage: the flags/width/precision tests already exist and pass (see `crates/driver/tests/run_printf_flags.rs`), along with hex/pointer/mixed/unsigned tests.

Checklist status
- [x] Expand printf coverage (flags/width/precision) — done; see `run_printf_flags.rs`.
- [x] Pointer subtraction — implemented; tests pass.

Next Focus Options
1) Function pointers and indirect calls: add parsing for function pointer declarators (AST type support), sema typing for calls via pointers, backend lowering for indirect calls; tests (sema + driver).
2) Aggregate initializers (minimal): support simple brace initializers for arrays/structs in parser/sema; backend emission for zero-inits and simple lists; tests.
3) Broaden integer promotions/usual arithmetic conversions tests: extend coverage matrices across signed/unsigned and widths; sema-only tests plus a few runtime checks.

Awaiting selection; ready to proceed.

[2025-08-30] Function Pointers End-to-End — Completed
- Parser
  - Function-pointer declarators supported across typedef/local/global: `typedef int (*F)(int);`, `int (*fp)(int,int);`.
- Sema
  - Function signatures table (built-ins + TU functions) in place; arity and fixed-arg type checking (incl. variadics) implemented.
  - Indirect calls validated via Expr::CallPtr and also via Expr::Call when the callee resolves to a function type or pointer-to-function.
  - Array-to-pointer decay on arguments used in checks.
- Backend
  - Indirect calls lowered: Expr::CallPtr emits `call i32 %fnptr(... )` using current calling convention (ptr for pointers/format, i32 for ints).
  - Existing direct-call and varargs handling (puts/printf) remain green.
- Tests
  - Backend: `crates/backend/tests/indirect_call.rs` passes.
  - Driver: `crates/driver/tests/run_fn_ptr.rs` passes (switching targets via &add/&sub prints expected results).
  - Full workspace is green (`cargo test -p parse -p sema -p backend -p wyrmcc`).

Checklist delta
- C. Semantics – Function pointers: end-to-end coverage achieved for current subset (Expr::CallPtr typing; designators accepted in calls). Further polish on “designators decay to pointer” and function-type compatibility can be handled during declarator grammar generalization.
- E. Backend – Indirect calls via function pointers: implemented (no bitcasts needed for current simplified i32/ptr convention).

Next Focus
1) Aggregate initializers (minimal)
   - Parser: brace initializers for arrays/structs (flat and simple nested cases).
   - Sema: type-check initializer lists; zero-initialization semantics.
   - Backend: emit constant aggregates for globals; simple stores for locals; zero-init support.
   - Tests: parse + sema unit tests; backend IR for globals; driver runtime for basic aggregate init and access.
2) Declarator grammar breadth
   - Parenthesized declarators beyond fn-ptr basics, abstract declarators (casts, parameter types without names), pointers-to-arrays and arrays-of-pointers; reject arrays of functions.
   - Tests first (parse-focused), then implementation.
3) UAC expansion (integers)
   - Broaden matrices across signed/unsigned mixes for arithmetic, comparisons, shifts, and ?:; add sema tests and a few driver runs.

Execution Checklist — Next Actions (updated)
- [ ] Aggregates: add parser+sema tests for brace initializers; implement; backend emission for zero-inits and simple lists; driver runtime checks.
- [ ] Declarators: add tests for parenthesized/abstract declarators and complex ptr/array combos; extend parser accordingly; keep sema tolerant; adjust as needed.
- [ ] UAC: extend integer conversion tests across operators; align sema/backend behaviors where gaps appear.
- [ ] Keep suites green: `cargo test -p parse -p sema -p backend -p wyrmcc`.

[2025-08-31] Declarators Grammar Update and Next Focus

Summary
- Parser
  - Implemented parenthesized and abstract declarators sufficient for common C89 patterns:
    - Pointer-to-array variables/typedefs/globals: `int (*p)[N];`, `typedef int (*P)[3];`, and top-level variants.
    - Function-pointer abstract casts: `(int (*)(int))0;`.
    - Pointer-to-array abstract casts: `(int (*)[3])0;`.
    - Continued support for arrays-of-pointers via unparenthesized forms `int *a[3];` and standard array declarators.
  - Tests added in `crates/parse/tests/parse_parenthesized_abstract_decls.rs` covering local decls, typedef inside a function, and abstract casts.
- Tests
  - Full parse, sema, backend, and driver suites remain green after changes.
- Git
  - Commits authored as "Eve the Coding Dragon" and pushed regularly to origin (e.g., a0e9e5f).

Checklist Updates
- A. Lexing/Parsing – Declarator grammar completeness
  - [x] Parenthesized declarators (baseline: function pointers and pointers-to-arrays)
  - [x] Abstract declarators (baseline: casts for function-pointers and pointers-to-arrays)
  - [~] Arrays of pointers, pointers to arrays — basic forms supported; rejecting arrays of functions remains to be enforced in sema.
  - Qualifiers-on-pointers and full storage-class placement breadth remain future work.
- G. Testing
  - Declarators matrix expanded with new parse tests; broader matrix still [ ] for more combinations and edge cases.

Next Focus
1) Aggregate initializers (minimal)
   - Parser: brace initializer lists for arrays and structs (simple nested allowed).
   - Sema: element/field checking, zero-fill remainder, size inference for unsized arrays.
   - Backend: constant initializers for globals; memset(0) + element stores for locals.
   - Tests: parse + sema; backend IR for globals; driver runtime for simple sums/field prints.
2) UAC expansion (integers)
   - Enrich sema matrix across signed/unsigned widths and operators; add a few runtime checks.

Execution Checklist — Next Actions (refreshed)
- [ ] Aggregates: add parser+sema tests for brace initializers; implement; backend IR/local init; driver runtime checks.
- [x] Declarators: implement parenthesized/abstract declarators sufficient for function pointers and pointer-to-arrays; add tests.
- [ ] UAC: extend integer conversion tests across operators; close any gaps uncovered.
- [ ] Keep suites green: `cargo test -p parse -p sema -p backend -p wyrmcc`.
[2025-08-31] Parser/Sema Maintenance And Void* Nulls
- Fixed parser: removed duplicated trailing block in crates/parse/src/parser.rs that caused a brace mismatch; parse tests green.
- Sema: accept null pointer constants (0 and (T*)0) for pointer parameters in direct/indirect calls; updated call checking. void* param/null tests now pass.
- Full workspace is green (parse, sema, backend, driver).

Checklist Delta
- C. Semantics – Pointers/arrays: Null pointer constants handling for params — done (0, (T*)0).

Next Focus Options
1) Composite type rules and incomplete types diagnostics (struct/union forward decls; extern array sizing)
2) Qualifiers (const/volatile) propagation in assignments/params
3) Broaden UAC matrices across signed/unsigned mixes (arith, compare, shift, ?:) plus runtime smoke
4) Driver CLI breadth (-E/-S/-c/-o, -I/-D/-U, multi-input) — basics exist; extend coverage tests

Execution Checklist — Next Actions
- [ ] Add sema tests for incomplete types and composite type rules; implement diagnostics
- [ ] Add driver CLI tests for -S/-c/-o and multi-input; fill any gaps
- [ ] Expand UAC runtime tests; align sema/backend where gaps appear
- [ ] Keep suites green: cargo test -p parse -p sema -p backend -p wyrmcc

[2025-08-31] Sema Incomplete/Composite Tests
- Added sema tests for incomplete types and composite array declarations:
  - Incomplete struct/union object errors; pointer-to-incomplete allowed
  - sizeof on incomplete struct and array element rejected
  - Global arrays: unsized↔sized OK; conflicting fixed sizes error; extern unsized then sized OK
- Result: All new tests pass with current sema, confirming support for incomplete-type diagnostics,
  sizeof completeness checks, and basic composite array size compatibility.

Checklist Delta
- C. Semantics – Incomplete Types and Composite Arrays: basic checks covered by tests — done (v1).

Next Focus Candidates
1) Driver CLI breadth: add tests for -S (emit IR), -c (object), -o, and multiple inputs; -I/-D/-U flags coverage
2) Qualifiers (const/volatile) propagation in assignments/params (tests + implementation)
3) UAC expansion across signed/unsigned mixes (arith/compare/shift/?:) with runtime smoke

Execution Checklist — Upcoming
- [ ] Add driver CLI tests for -S/-c/-o and multi-input; fill any gaps in driver
- [ ] Add sema tests for qualifiers propagation; implement as needed
- [ ] Expand UAC test matrices (sema + a few runtime checks)
- [ ] Keep suites green: cargo test -p parse -p sema -p backend -p wyrmcc
